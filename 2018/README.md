## Context
For the 2018 Advent of Code, I thought it would be fun to try a different programming language for each day, some of which I had little or no experience in.  This code should not be evaluated in terms of cleverness, efficency, or syntax.

## Days
* Day 1 - Swift
* Day 2 - Ruby
* Day 3 - Rust
